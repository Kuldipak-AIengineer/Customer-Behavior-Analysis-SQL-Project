# ðŸ§  Customer Behavior Analysis SQL Project

This project explores the **customer lifecycle** â€” from acquisition to churn â€” using SQL queries on a simulated e-commerce database. It includes structured analysis of customer registrations, conversions, retention, and churn behaviors.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Objectives

Analyze and generate insights from customer behavior data:

- Customer acquisition and registration trends
- Conversion analysis (who purchases and when)
- Retention metrics (repeat purchases, gaps)
- Churn indicators
- Channel-wise and time-wise performance

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Overview

We simulate an online store with the following key tables:

### 1. `customers`
- Personal & registration details
- Foreign Key: `channel_id`
- Timestamps: `registration_date`, `first_order_date`, `last_order_date`

### 2. `orders`
- All orders placed by customers
- Foreign Key: `customer_id`

### 3. `order_items`
- Line items within each order
- Foreign Keys: `order_id`, `product_id`

### 4. `products`
- Products sold in the store
- Foreign Key: `category_id`

### 5. `categories`
- Product categories

### 6. `channels`
- How a customer found our site (e.g., Email, Social, Organic, Referral)
